# 📄 Document Q&A Assistant (RAG-based)

This project is a document-based question answering application where users can upload files (such as PDFs) and ask questions about their content. The system retrieves relevant parts of the uploaded documents and generates answers grounded in those documents.

I built this project to understand and implement the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow end to end, while keeping the interface simple and easy to use.
